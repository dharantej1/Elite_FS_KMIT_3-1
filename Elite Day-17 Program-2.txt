In Hyderabad after a long pandemic gap, the Telangana Youth festival Is 
Organized at HITEX. In HITEX, there are a lot of programs planned. During 
the festival in order to maintain the rules of Pandemic, they put a 
constraint that one person can only attend any one of the programs in 
one day according to planned days.

Now it’s your aim to implement the "Solution" class in such a way that 
you need to return the maximum number of programs you can attend according 
to given constraints.

Explanation:
You have a list of programs ‘p’ and days ’d’, where you can attend only 
one program on one day. Programs [p] = [first day, last day], 
p is the program's first day and the last day.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of programs.
Line-2: N comma separated pairs, each pair(f_day, l_day) is separated by space.

Output Format:
--------------
An integer, the maximum number of programs you can attend.

n=int(input())
l=[]
for i in range(n):
    l.append(list(map(int,input().split()))[:2])
l1=[]
for i in l:
    for j in i:
        if j not in l1:
            l1.append(j)
print(len(l1))
