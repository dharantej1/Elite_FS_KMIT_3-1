EA Sports, developed a video game. They designed a game in such a way that, 
there are L number of levels from 1 to L. There are D number of dependencies
where each dependency[m] = [ Xm, Ym ], represents a prerequisite relationship,
that is, in order to play level-Ym, you must have completed the level-Xm.

In one day you can complete any number of levels as long as you 
have completed all the prerequisites levels in the game. 

You cannont play a level-Ym which has some prerequisite level-Xm on same day.

Write a method to return the minimum number of days to complete all the levels
in the game. If there is no way to complete all the levels, return -1.

Output Format:
--------------
An integer, the minimum number of days to complete all the levels in the game.
