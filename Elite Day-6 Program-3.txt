Initially Tejaswi has 0 points with her.
Can you help Tejaswi to score maximum number of points.

Line-1 -> an integers N, number of numbers on the game board.
Line-2 -> N space separated integers, numbers on the game board nums[].

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer as result, maximum score she can get.


Sample Input-1:

3
4 5 3
