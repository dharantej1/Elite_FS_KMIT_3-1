Bablu is working in a construction field.
He has N number of building blocks, where the height and width of all the blocks are same.
And the length of each block is given in an array, blocks[].

Bablu is planned to build a wall in the form of a square.
The rules to cunstruct the wall are as follows:
	- He should use all the building blocks.
	- He should not break any building block, but you can attach them with other.
	- Each building-block must be used only once.
	
Your task is to check whether Bablu can cunstruct the wall as a square
with the given rules or not. If possible, print true. Otherwise, print false.
